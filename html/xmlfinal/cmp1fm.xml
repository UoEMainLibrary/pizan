<div4><title type="main"><emph rend="headline">Une Autre Complainte Amoureuse</emph></title></div4>

<div4>The <emph rend="italic">Complainte</emph> is introduced by a miniature and a rubric. There is a complete set of running titles, save that the title on fol. 57r has been almost entirely cropped by the binder.</div4>

 <div4>The poem is made up of 15 seizains, rhyming <emph rend="italic">a10a10a10b4b10b10b10c4c10c10c10d4d10d10d10e4e10e10e10f4</emph> etc. The metrical structure is identical to that of the other two <emph rend="italic">Complaintes</emph> in the Queen's MS: Item 10 (<emph rend="italic">Une Complainte Amoureuse</emph>), and the conclusion of Item 18 (<emph rend="italic">Le Livre du Duc des Vrais Amans</emph>).</div4>

<div4>The opening line of Stanza 1 is set off by a champie initial and a border. The plan that each of the other stanzas should be introduced by a paragraph mark was not fully implemented. Only six were executed, before Stanzas 7 and 11-15; the marginal instructions left before Stanzas 2-6 and 8-10 were overlooked. This edition makes good these oversights and thus contains a complete set of paragraph marks.</div4>

<div4>There is no obvious reason for the one blank line, which is found halfway through Stanza 1.  With that exception, the stanzas are copied without a break. In this edition a blank line has been left after each stanza, mirroring the layout of the other two <emph rend="italic">Complaintes</emph>.</div4>
