<div class="frontmatter">
<br><span class="headline"><b>Une Autre Complainte Amoureuse</b></span><br>

<br>The <span class="italic">Complainte</span> is introduced by a miniature and a rubric. There is a complete set of running titles, save that the title on fol. 57r has been almost entirely cropped by the binder.<br>

 <br>The poem is made up of 15 seizains, rhyming <span class="italic">a10a10a10b4b10b10b10c4c10c10c10d4d10d10d10e4e10e10e10f4</span> etc. The metrical structure is identical to that of the other two <span class="italic">Complaintes</span> in the Queen's MS: Item 10 (<span class="italic">Une Complainte Amoureuse</span>), and the conclusion of Item 18 (<span class="italic">Le Livre du Duc des Vrais Amans</span>).<br>

<br>The opening line of Stanza 1 is set off by a champie initial and a border. The plan that each of the other stanzas should be introduced by a paragraph mark was not fully implemented. Only six were executed, before Stanzas 7 and 11-15; the marginal instructions left before Stanzas 2-6 and 8-10 were overlooked.<br>

<br>There is no obvious reason for the one blank line, which is found halfway through Stanza 1.  With that exception, the stanzas are copied without a break. In this edition a blank line has been left after each stanza, mirroring the layout of the other two <span class="italic">Complaintes</span>.<br>
