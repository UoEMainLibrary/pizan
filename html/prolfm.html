<br>
Folios 3r-3v of the Queen's MS contain the only known
copy of the <span class="italic">Prologue adre&ccedil;ant &agrave; la royne</span> in which Christine
de Pizan dedicates her collection to Queen Isabeau. 
The poem's importance is highlighted by the 
frontispiece on f. 3r: the miniature spanning columns a and b is framed by a  richly elaborated border.
The scene is the Queen's bedroom where Christine kneels to present her book to Isabeau
who is accompanied by six of her ladies.
<br>
<br>
The poem has no rubric; the opening line being written
immediately under the miniature. The title just quoted is
taken from the <span class="italic">Table</span> (f. 2c). 
The <span class="italic">Prologue</span> is made up of
eight douzains in octosyllables rhyming 
<span class="italic">aabaabbaabaa ccdccdddcddc</span> etc.;
none of the sixteen rhymes is repeated. 
<br>
<br>The opening stanza is introduced by 
a decorated capital 'T' for which a five-line space has been reserved. 
The first line of all but one of the other stanzas is enhanced,   
now by an elaborate initial penned by the scribe (stanzas 2, 5, 7-8),
now by a paragraph mark (stanzas 4-8), now in both ways (stanzas 5, 7-8). 
The beginning of stanza 3 has no distinguishing feature.  
<br>
<br>Blank lines have been inserted between the stanzas in this edition; there are none in the manuscript.<br>
