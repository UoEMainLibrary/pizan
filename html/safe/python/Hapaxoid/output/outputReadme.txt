This readme file discusses some sample files in the output directory of the Hapaxoid application, written by Tommy Herbert for Charlie Mansfield and Jim Laidlaw.  For an overview, see readme.txt in the main Hapaxoid directory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

To create the files hapSets.txt and hapSets.pkl, I ran the findHapSets.py script with its default settings, under IDLE.  I then used IDLE to open the hapSetToText.py script and changed the inputFilename parameter to 'output/hapSets'.  Saving and running it created the file doulour.txt.  Finally, I opened hapSetToGraph.py, changed the inputFilename parameter to 'output/hapSets' as before, saved and ran to produce doulour.png.  Maybe page 200 sees the entry of a new scribe who doesn't like the 'doulour' spelling quite so much?  Or maybe Tommy knows nothing about Middle French.  We'll never be sure.
