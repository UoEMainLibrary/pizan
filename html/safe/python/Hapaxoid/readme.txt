This software is for finding and plotting variant spellings in the Queen's Manuscript.

The simplest way to use it is by running the three scripts findHapSets.py, hapSetToText.py and hapSetToGraph.py.  I hope they'll cover everything you might want to do: you'll want to use findHapSets.py first, and then either hapSetToText.py or hapSetToGraph.py can be applied to the output.  To use any of the scripts, you should first open the file and, following the instructions you find there, adjust the parameters to your liking.  Then run the code using Idle, from a terminal, or any way you like.

The other '.py' files in the root directory contain fully annotated Python code that you can alter if you need different functionality.  Please let me know any time - it could be years from now, I'm not fussed - if anything needs fixing or if you want minor additions.

In the 'testMaterials' directory there are various bits and pieces with much less annotation.  I thought I might as well throw them in, but I hope you'll never need them.  If Hapaxoid still has bugs, please do tell me and I'll mend them.

I've run the scripts to produce some sample output.  The results are in the 'output' directory, along with another readme file that discusses them.

Finally, t.txt is the input file used by the software.  It contains the entire Queen's Manuscript transcription.
