<div class="frontmatter">
<br><span class="headline"><b>Le Livre du duc des vrais amans</b></span>
<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Livre du duc des vrais amans</span> is divided into 6 sections:
<br>
<br>
1) the <span class="italic">Livre</span> (DVAL), a narrative in heptasyllabic couplets,
    interspersed with <span class="italic">formes fixes</span> (15 ballades, 3 rondeaux,
    1 virelai) and 8 letters in prose. 
<br>
<br>
2) an epilogue (DVAE) made up of 12 heptasyllabic couplets.

<br>
<br>
3) a collection of 9 <span class="italic">Balades de plusieurs fa&ccedil;ons</span> (DVAB).
<br>
<br>
4) a collection of 3 <span class="italic">Virelais</span> (DVAV).
<br>
<br>
5) a collection of 4 <span class="italic">Rondiaulx</span> (DVAR).
<br>
<br>
6) a <span class="italic">Complainte</span> (DVAC).
<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Livre du duc des vrais amans</span> 
is extant in only two manuscripts, London, BL, Harley 4431 andParis, BnF, f.fr. 836.
The work was edited by Maurice Roy in 1896 (<span class="italic">Oeuvres po&eacute;tiques de
Christine de Pisan</span>, Paris: SATF, vol. 3,  pp. 59-208), who based his text on the Paris MS. 
A new edition, based on the Harley MS, was published by Thelma S. Fenster in 1995:
 (<span class="italic">Christine de Pizan: Le Livre du duc des vrais amans</span>, Binghamton, NY:
Medieval &amp; Renaissance texts &amp; studies 124, 261 pp.).
The verse lines are numbered in both editions. From line 2066 onwards Fenster's
line numbers, which are used here, 
are greater by one than those in Roy's edition, because
Fenster numbers the missing line, discussed below.<br>
<br>
The copy of the <span class="italic">Livre du duc des vrais amans</span> in the
Queen's MS is carefully executed; the text is notably free of
abbreviations. The errors and emendations made by the scribe
and the reviser's corrections are surprisingly few in number.
Lines of verse have been copied twice on ff. 151c and 174b,
the second copy being scored out. The scribe has left a blank
line on fol. 157c to show that line 2067 is missing.
<br>
<br>The work contains five 'split rhymes': 
 The first syllable(s) of the rhyme-word provide the rhyme and the
 remaining syllable(s) are carried over to the next line.  
Two of the split rhymes are adverbs ending in <span class="italic">&#8211;ment</span> (lines 1513-4, 1598-9),
 two are a form  of <span class="italic">avoir</span> (lines 2055-6, 2385-6); the last example
is <span class="italic">tour&#8211;noy&eacute;</span> (lines 953-4) . The scribe has copied <span class="italic">-Ment</span> once with a capital;
in all the other instances the new line begins with a small letter,
which has been retained.<br>
<br>
The refrains of the <span class="italic">ballades</span>, are written
 now in full, now in abbreviated form. The  refrains of 
<span class="italic">virelais</span> <span class="italic">rondeaux</span> 
are presented differently: they are always abbreviated and always inset.  Both layouts have been reproduced, as has the use - and
sometimes the absence - of blank lines. The majority of the errors
in the text have been corrected by reference to BnF, f.fr. 836.<br>
<br>The refrains have been set in italic, in accordance with modern practice.<br>
