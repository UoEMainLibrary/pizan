<br><span class="headline"><b>Complainte Amoureuse</b></span><br>
<br>Harley MS 4431 contains the only known copy of the <span class="italic">Complainte Amoureuse</span>. The unusual structure of Quire 5 shows that the <span class="italic">Complainte</span>, together with <span class="italic">Encore Aultres Balades</span>, the item immediately following, was added to the Queen's MS at the very last minute.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Complainte</span> is introduced by a miniature and a rubric; there is only one running title, on fol. 49r. The poem is made up of 12 seizains, rhyming <span class="italic">a10a10a10b4b10b10b10c4c10c10c10d4d10d10d10e4e10e10e10f4</span> etc. The opening line of each stanza is set off: by a champie initial with a border (Stanza 1) or by a paragraph mark (Stanzas 2-12); unusually, Stanza 9 contains a second paragraph mark, at line 135. A blank line has been left after each stanza, except after Stanzas 2 and 11. Lines 149-51 have been copied twice; the second version is scored through by a single vertical line.<br>
